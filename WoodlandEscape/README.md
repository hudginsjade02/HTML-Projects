# Woodland Escape
## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/N5p0CSVokPI
###### Description:
You wake up in a strange woodland, and it has an extremely eerie feeling to it. You realize it will be dark soon.
You have two main path options to take. Which way will you go, and what will you see along the way?

This is a creepy "Choose Your Own Adventure" game, where your main objective is to get out of the woods. However, there are a few endings.
Some say that you are not successful, and others say you are! This story might test your curiosity.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Click on any of the hyperlinks to make your decision on what to do or where to go.
There is optional audio at the very top of each page.
*If you would prefer a less silent and more ambient experience, then I suggest pressing the play button on each page!*

**INFORMATION:**
Every HTML file contains a path, depending on what the user clicks. The "home.html" file is the main file, where the user starts.
All HTML files are linked together in some way as well, so no matter what the user clicks, they will be on the path.
    -"home.html" is the homepage; where the player begins.
    -"look_up1.html" is the path in which the user looks up.
    -"look_left1.html" shows the first left path.
        *If the user takes this path:*
            -"left_path1.html" shows the first obstacle of the left path; a hut. They have the option to investigate, keep going, or go back (being "home.html").
            
            *If they choose to investigate:*
                -"hut_inside.html" shows the main inside of the hut.
                -"look_left2.html" shows what the hut looks like to the left of the player.
                -"look_right2.html" shows what the hut looks like to the right of the player.
                -"doorway.html" takes the player further inside the hut.
                -"move_rug.html" lets the user check what's under the rug.
                -"basement.html" lets the user go down into the basement.
                -"basement2.html" lets the user check the small hole in the basement.
                -"look_left3.html" only shows the player a wall.
                -"look_right3.html" shows the player someone standing in the corner of the basement room.
                -"call3.html" prompts the player to call to the person.
                -"ask.html", "ask2.html", and "ask3.html" prompts the user to question the person.
                -"say.html" prompts the user to speak to the person.
                
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going1.html" shows the left path the further you go. They can choose to follow the river, keep going, or go back (being "home.html").
                
                *If the user chooses to go down the river:*
                -"down (underscore) the (underscore) river.html" lets the user investigate what is down the river.
                -"skull.html" lets the player investigate what they find by the river (a skull). There is not much to do with this path.
            
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going2.html" shows further into the woods. The user can "hear" something behind them. They can check or they can keep going.
                
                *If the user chooses to look behind them:*
                -"behind_you.html" shows the user what is behind them. They can call to it or run away.
               
               *If the user calls to it:*
                -"call.html" and "call2.html" prompts the user to call to what is behind them (spoiler: a zombie!) They can fight back or run away.
                
                *If the user chooses to fight back:*
                -"fight.html" allows them to fight back, but they get bitten.
                -"going (underscore) bite.html" and "going (underscore) bite.html" lets the user go further into the woods with the bite.
                    -The user has the option to check their wound, prompting the "check_bite.html" page to show.
                -"end_zombie.html" is the zombie ending, and one of the failure endings.
                
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going3.html" allows the user to keep going.
            
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -going4.html" allows the user to keep going, or they can find somewhere to rest in the woods.
                    
                    *If they choose to rest:*
                    -"sleep.html" shows the user somewhere they can rest, but when they wake, they are brought back to "home.html". Another failure ending.
            
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"end_out1.html" shows the user a paved road, where they make it safely to civilization. This is one of the good endings.
            
        **IF AT ANY POINT THE USER CHOOSES "GO BACK", THEY ARE SIMPLY BROUGHT FURTHER BACK FROM THEIR PATH, EVENTUALLY BACK TO THE START**
    
    "look_right1.html" shows the first right path.
        *If the user takes this path:*
            -"right_path1.html" shows the user their first obstacle: a tree across the path. They can try to move it, climb over it, or go back (being "home.html").
            
            *If the user chooses to try to move it:*
            -"move_tree.html" prompts them with a failed attempt to try and move it. They must climb over it or go back to the start.
            
            *If the user chooses to climb over it:*
            -"right_path2.html" shows the player a cave they have come across. They can either investigate, keep going, or go back.
            
            *If the user chooses to go back:*
            -"tree_reversed.html" reverses the options. If they climb back over it they end up back at the start. If they choose to go back, they go back to the cave.
            
            *If the user chooses to investigate:*
                -"cave.html" is the beginning of the inside of the cave. Not much but to either go back or keep going.
                
                *If they choose to keep going inside the cave:*
                -"cave2.html" shows the user the beautiful cave lake they have found. They can investigate the water or go back.
                
                    *If they choose to investigate the water:*
                    -"water.html" shows the player some danger by saying that something is there.
                        
                        *If they choose to check the water:*
                        -"check_water.html" prompts the player with a danger; a large fish. They can either fight it or run away.
                        
                        *If they choose to fight:*
                        -"fight2.html" results in the user getting bit by the fish, but no further major consequences. All that is left is to leave.
                    
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going5.html" shows the player that they have gone further in the woods, but they "see" something close by. They can either investigate, keep going, or go back.
                
                *If the user chooses to investigate what they see:*
                    -"ritual_ring.html" shows the player a ritual ring of rocks. They can either step into it or leave.
                    
                    *If the user chooses to step into it:*
                    -"ritual.html" says that the player hears something from where they had previously stood. They can either look or run away.
                    
                    *If the player chooses to look:*
                    -"druid.html" shows the player the hooded figure that was spying on them.
                    -"ask4.html" prompts the user to ask the hooded figure a question.
                    -"end_sacrifice1.html" says that the player is struck in the head and passes out.
                    -"end_sacrifice2.html" says that the player is the sacrifice to a ritual. This is another failure ending.
                    
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going6.html" allows the user to keep going.
                
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"going7.html" allows the user to keep going, or they can find somewhere to rest.
                
                *If they choose to rest:*
                    -"sleep.html" shows the user somewhere they can rest, but when they wake, they are brought back to "home.html". Another failure ending.
            
            *If the user chooses to keep going:*
                -"end_out2.html" shows the user a watchtower, where they are found by someone and considered safe. Another positive ending.
    
    **IF AT ANY POINT THE USER CHOOSES "GO BACK", THEY ARE SIMPLY BROUGHT FURTHER BACK FROM THEIR PATH, EVENTUALLY BACK TO THE START**
    
The "style.css" is where the text and background styles are preset.
The mp3 files, all named "Kevin Macleod..." are popular royalty-free audio files, and are needed for the audio to work properly for the pages.

I almost made this project in Python.
I had made a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game in Python once for my regular university class in my freshman year.
However, I was not sure if I could import a GUI of any kind in the CS50 IDE.
Therefore, I chose HTML and CSS for a more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience.

I had fun making this project, even if it took me a long time to create and make every possible path and link them together properly.
I would like to continue making games like this, where your choices affect your story.

**While I did not have time in my demo video to show every possible ending, I will list them here:**

You find a paved road, and you make it back to civilization safely. *SHOWN IN DEMO*
You find a watchtower, where somebody finds you and you are safe.
You are bitten by a zombie, and you, in turn, become a zombie.
You become a sacrifice to a strange cult.
You fall asleep in the woods, and wake up back where you started.
